# Movie-Database
A team-based, semester-long movie database project.
This project required our group of 5 (3 of us worked on this code) to create a database to keep track of movies, their cast
members, ratings, and watch count for multiple users. It is a scaled down version of what
Netflix can do.

I personally created the follow, unfollow, newReleases, play, userprofile, and search files, and assisted in the making of the actual database in DataGrip.
